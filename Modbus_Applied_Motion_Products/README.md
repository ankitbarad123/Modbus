Example of Modbus Protocol with Applied Motion Products devices
- MDX+ Integrated Servo Motor with Modbus TCP 
- Reading and Writing Holding Registers

Important note:- 
When communicating Modbus devices with PLC, user need to make sure that they are mapping PLC/HMI holding register 40001 to AMP device 40000. 
-- Applied Motion Modbus devices Holding register start from 40001 where many PLC/HMI use 40000 as the first holding register address.
